### LuxuraStyle - **Luxury E-Commerce Web Application**

Welcome to **LuxuraStyle**, a premium e-commerce platform for luxury fashion and accessories. LuxuraStyle enables customers to shop for high-end clothing, shoes, handbags, jewelry, and lifestyle products from the most exclusive brands. This README serves as a guide to understand the project's structure, coding practices, and how to get started with developing or contributing to the platform.

---

## **Project Overview**

LuxuraStyle is an e-commerce web application built using **Java**, **Spring Framework**, **Hibernate**, and **JDBC**. It follows a modular architecture, where each feature is organized into modules such as `Product`, `Order`, `Customer`, and more. Each module is responsible for specific functionalities of the platform, and it adheres to key design patterns (DAO, Repository, Factory, etc.) to maintain clean, reusable, and testable code.

The platform includes the following key features:
- **Product Browsing**: View curated luxury fashion items.
- **Customer Authentication**: Sign-up, login, and profile management for customers.
- **Order Management**: Seamless checkout process with order tracking.
- **Payment Integration**: Payment via multiple gateways such as credit cards and PayPal.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Recommend products based on browsing history and preferences.

## **Project Structure**

The code is organized into modules following a clear **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern. Each module is structured as follows:
- **Controller**: Responsible for handling HTTP requests and defining API endpoints.
- **Service**: Handles business logic and interactions between controllers and repositories.
- **Repository**: Provides database access and interactions through Hibernate or JDBC.
- **DAO (Data Access Object)**: Manages lower-level data access details, abstracting the complexity of database queries.
- **Model**: Represents the entities used in the application (e.g., `Product`, `Customer`, etc.).

## **Coding Practices**

To maintain a clean and scalable codebase, we follow these coding principles:

### 1. **Modular Structure**:
- Code is organized into separate modules, with each module containing its **Controller**, **Service**, **Repository**, and **DAO** classes. This separation of concerns makes the application easier to manage and extend.

### 2. **Design Patterns**:
- **DAO Pattern**: The **DAO** classes encapsulate all database operations, keeping the data access layer separate from business logic.
- **Repository Pattern**: Repositories are used to interact with the database using Hibernate and provide a higher-level abstraction over the DAO.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Singletons are used in certain components to ensure there is only one instance, particularly for services or utility classes.
- **Factory Pattern**: Factories can be used for object creation, particularly when instantiating entities like orders, customers, or payments.
- **Template Pattern**: Used in scenarios such as payment processing to define a fixed template while allowing the implementation to vary (e.g., CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment).

### 3. **MVC Architecture**:
- The project follows the **Model-View-Controller** (MVC) architecture where:
  - **Controller** manages the incoming requests and responses.
  - **Service** handles business logic.
  - **Repository** and **DAO** manage database access.
  - **Model** defines the application's data structure.

### 4. **Exception Handling**:
- Exception handling is consistent and centralized. Custom exceptions are thrown where necessary, with global exception handling configured using Spring’s `@ControllerAdvice`.

### 5. **Unit Testing**:
- The project is fully testable with unit tests implemented for Services and Controllers using JUnit. Integration tests for DAO classes ensure database functionality is correct.
